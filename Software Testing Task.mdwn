4. Example of a Functional Bug
		Lets assume in your application under test you want to create a new user with user information, for that, you need to login into the application and navigate to USERS menu > New User, then enter all the details in the ‘User form’ like, First Name, Last Name, Age, Address, Phone etc. Once you enter all this information, you need to click on the ‘SAVE’ button in order to save the user. Now you can see a success message saying, “New User has been created successfully”. But when you entered into your application by logging in and navigated to USERS menu > New user, entered all the required information to create the new user and clicked on SAVE button. 
        The application crashed and you got one error page on the screen.
